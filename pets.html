            <p class="text">
                Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that
                his family has gifted him. <br> He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't 
                see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing 
                them.
            </p> 
            <P class="text">
                At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will 
                place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of 
                rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
            </P>

            <h2>Kiki the Cat</h2>
            <img src="images/kiki_normal.jpg" width = "400" alt="A British Shorthair sitting calmly on a cushion" class="big">
            <p>
                Meet Kiki, a lovely six-year-old British Shorthair cat who rules the roost in our home in Shanghai, China. Originally 
                brought in this family as a birthday present for his two human sisters, Kiki has become the heart and soul of our 
                household. His sisters love and adore him immensely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kiki is not your average feline; he's a lively and playful boy. You'll frequently catch glimpses of him sprinting through 
                the house or scaling the highest points, whether it's the closet or refrigerator. Despite his naughty antics, every 
                member of the family holds a special place in their hearts for him. Kiki has woven himself into the fabric of our lives,
                 bringing joy, laughter, and a whole lot of adventure.
            </p>

            <h2>That Golden Retriever Sage</h2>
            <img src="images/sage_classic.jpeg" width = "400" alt="A Golden Retriever lying comfortably on a bed" class="big">
            <p>Sage is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs. She loves sneaking into the bedroom and hopping 
                onto the neatest bed. She also loves riding in a car with the windows open feeling the wind and air. She enjoys walking, 
                only if you take her for a ride to a big arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily her cup 
                of tea. 
            </p>
            <p>Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the dining table, which was surprising because she is 
                normally gentle and polite. She took the stolen corn to the patio and enjoyed her meal by herself. Unfortunately, the 
                corn turned out to be unripe, so she ended up vomiting it all later.
