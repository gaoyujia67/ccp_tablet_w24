            <h2>Apple Pie</h2>
            <p>Apple pie holds a cherished place in American culinary history, symbolizing tradition and comfort. Its roots trace back 
                to early European settlers, who brought apple seeds and pie-making skills to the New World. By the 19th century, apple

                nostalgia.
